My yaml configs for esphome (def not vibecoded)

# The AlarmClock/Nighttime device for controling your smarthome

I have no idea what to call this (maybe prehistoric dashboard?)

It consists of: Smol OLED Display, Buttons (or rotary knob whichever one you like), Microcontroller, GUI menu to control things around your room, Clock 

For this to be an alarm clock you still have to add a speaker

[YAML here](OLED.yaml)

[Test code for no buttons](testcode.yaml)

To actually use this yourself you still have to make a lot of changes so be warned!

# Blinds based on stepper motor

Blind motor that uses the uln2003 motor driver + some 3d printed parts

[YAML here](blinds.yaml)

# Gate/Garage Door Opener 
Uses a remote(one button) and a contact sensor that detects wheter the gate is opened or not

[YAML here](gate.yaml)

I'd like to thank our benefactors for allowing this to happen
