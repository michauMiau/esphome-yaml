# The AlarmClock/Nighttime device for controling your smarthome/little control thingy with buttons and an oled

I have no idea what to call this (maybe prehistoric dashboard?)

It consists of: Smol OLED Display, Buttons (or rotary knob whichever one you like), Microcontroller, GUI menu to control things around your room, Clock 

For this to be an alarm clock you still have to add a speaker

[Yaml here](https://github.com/michauMiau/esphome-yaml/blob/ca624ee7792400c6b089adcec9874378aeb38857/OLED.yaml)

To actually use this yourself you still have to make a lot of changes so be warned!
